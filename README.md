# Tools

The test can be administered via [VS Code Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share)

The generated link gives an anonymous browser:
1. access to your locally running vscode instance
2. allows read/write of the file-system opened in vscode
3. does not allow access to the terminal (to execute arbitrary commands)
4. does allow view access of the terminal (so jest --watch works for both parties)
