## Create a solution that fulfils the following requirements:

1. Validates if an input string is a palindrome

2. Will score the palindrome based on the length

3. Can capture the user who submitted the palindrome

4. A user can not score points for a palindrome that has already been recorded by another user

5. Can retrieve a high score table with the top 3 palindromes along with the user

6. Can retrieve a high score table with the top 3 highest scoring users of all time

 
## Tips:

- Please don’t worry about the UI
- Write tests
– Keep it simple and avoid redundant code
